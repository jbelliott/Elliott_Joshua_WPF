Problem Solving


A Cat, A Parrot, and a Bag of Seed

The Problem: The man with a cat, parrot, and bag of seed cannot cross the river with all three items at the same time, but cannot leave the bird with the seed or cat with the bird.  The objective is to get all items across the river in tact with the man by making several trips.

Insight: Any item can be left alone, but only one pair can be left together without consequence: the cat and birdseed.  This means the first trip must be the man and the parrot.

Goal:  Take items across the river with the man in his boat, one at a time, without leaving the wrong two items together.

Constraints and sub-goals:  The cat and parrot and parrot and seed cannot be left alone together.  Only one item can be taken by boat at a time.

Potential Solution:  Move the parrot across the river.  Return alone.  Move the cat across the river. Return with the parrot.  Move the birdseed across the river. Return alone. Move the parrot across the river.

Evaluation:  Working through the problem, the items can be moved in this manner without violating the rules, and it results in the objective being met.


Socks in the Dark:

There are 20 socks in a drawer:  5 pairs of black socks, 3 pairs of brown, and 2 pairs of white.  You select the socks in the dark and can check them only after a selection has been made.  What is the smallest number of socks you need to select to guarantee getting the following:

a. At least one matching pair
b. At least one matching pair of each color



Predicting Fingers:

A little girl counts using the fingers of her left hand as follows:  She starts by calling her thumb 1, the first finger 2, middle finger 3, ring finger 4, and little finger 5.  Then she reverses direction, calling the ring finger 6, middle finger 7, first finger 8, and thumb 9, after which she calls her first finger 10 and so on.  If she continues to count in this manner, on which finger will she stop?

a. What if the girl counts from 1 to 10
b. What if the girl counts from 1 to 100
c. What if the girl counts from 1 to 1000
