Problem Solving


A Cat, A Parrot, and a Bag of Seed

The Problem: The man with a cat, parrot, and bag of seed cannot cross the river with all three items at the same time, but cannot leave the bird with the seed or cat with the bird.  The objective is to get all items across the river in tact with the man by making several trips.

Insight: Any item can be left alone, but only one pair can be left together without consequence: the cat and birdseed.  This means the first trip must be the man and the parrot.

Goal:  Take items across the river with the man in his boat, one at a time, without leaving the wrong two items together.

Constraints and sub-goals:  The cat and parrot and parrot and seed cannot be left alone together.  Only one item can be taken by boat at a time.

Potential Solution:  Move the parrot across the river.  Return alone.  Move the cat across the river. Return with the parrot.  Move the birdseed across the river. Return alone. Move the parrot across the river.

Evaluation:  Working through the problem, the items can be moved in this manner without violating the rules, and it results in the objective being met.

Final Explanation: First, the man must take the parrot across the river.  This leaves the cat and seed—the only two items that can be left alone together.  He returns alone to the original shore and picks up the cat, leaving the birdseed alone.  When he makes the other shore, he cannot leave these two items alone, so he will leave the cat and take the parrot back with him on the return trip.  He will swap the parrot for the seed and make his trip back across again, leaving the seed with the cat on the far bank of the river.  His return trip is made alone.  He picks up the parrot and makes his final trip across the river.


Socks in the Dark:

The Problem: With 20 socks in a drawer, 10 pair total (5 black, 3 brown, 2 white).  By selecting socks in the dark, we are attempting to determine the smallest number of socks that can be selected before we can guarantee we have at least one matching pair.  Then again, but getting a matching pair of each color.
Insight:  This is an issue with statistics.  Guaranteeing matching sock pairs will likely be calculated based on the number of socks and number of colors represented.

Goal: The goal is to pick the minimum number of  socks required to guarantee a matching pair and a matching pair of each color.





Predicting Fingers:

A little girl counts using the fingers of her left hand as follows:  She starts by calling her thumb 1, the first finger 2, middle finger 3, ring finger 4, and little finger 5.  Then she reverses direction, calling the ring finger 6, middle finger 7, first finger 8, and thumb 9, after which she calls her first finger 10 and so on.  If she continues to count in this manner, on which finger will she stop?

a. What if the girl counts from 1 to 10
b. What if the girl counts from 1 to 100
c. What if the girl counts from 1 to 1000
